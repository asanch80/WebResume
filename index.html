            <img src="Images/pwbilogo.png" alt="Powerbi Logo" height="70" id="pwbilogo">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">As a PowerBI Data Analyst, I have successfully integrated Tenable Security Center data with PowerBI to provide the Cybersecurity Department with actionable insights and visualizations on network vulnerabilities and security risks. By leveraging the combination of PowerBI's interactive reporting capabilities and Tenable's vulnerability scanning tools, I streamlined the process of monitoring, analyzing, and presenting cybersecurity risk data.</p>
            <h3>Key Responsibilities and Achievements</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Data Integration: <br> <br>
                Utilized Tenable Security Center's API to extract vulnerability scan data, such as security risks, compliance issues, and threat assessments, and imported the data into PowerBI for analysis and reporting.
                Ensured smooth integration by transforming raw Tenable data into a structured format using Power Query and custom scripts, enabling real-time data updates.
                <br> <br>Custom Vulnerability Dashboards: <br> <br>
                Designed and developed custom PowerBI dashboards to track key security metrics such as vulnerability severity (CVSS score), affected assets, exposure times, and remediation progress.
                Presented critical insights on top security risks, prioritized vulnerabilities based on their impact on the organization‚Äôs systems, and helped highlight high-risk areas needing immediate attention.
                <br> <br>Trend Analysis:<br> <br>
                Used Power BI's analytical tools to identify trends in vulnerability occurrences over time, providing the cybersecurity team with predictive insights on potential future risks.
                Leveraged Power BI‚Äôs DAX formulas to create metrics such as average time to remediate vulnerabilities and trends in system compliance across the enterprise.
                <br> <br>Real-Time Reporting and Alerts:<br> <br>
                Created real-time, automated reporting systems in PowerBI to send regular updates and alerts to the cybersecurity team, ensuring they are informed about high-priority vulnerabilities and compliance issues.
                Enabled the creation of alerts and notifications in PowerBI when new critical vulnerabilities were detected by Tenable scans, facilitating quicker response times.
                <br> <br>Enhanced Collaboration:<br> <br>
                Delivered interactive and user-friendly dashboards to key stakeholders, including security analysts, risk management teams, and executives, allowing them to drill down into vulnerability data and make data-driven decisions.
                Collaborated with cybersecurity engineers and system administrators to ensure the accuracy of vulnerability data and adjust report metrics according to the evolving threat landscape.
                <br> <br>Reporting for Compliance and Auditing:<br> <br>
                Developed compliance-focused reports based on industry standards such as NIST, CIS, and PCI DSS, helping the organization meet audit and regulatory requirements.
                Produced detailed vulnerability reports and visualizations for external audits, ensuring transparency and supporting evidence of ongoing security efforts.
                By combining PowerBI‚Äôs powerful visualization and Tenable Security Center‚Äôs comprehensive vulnerability data, I was able to enhance the Cybersecurity Department's ability to quickly identify, prioritize, and remediate security risks, ultimately improving the organization's overall security posture.
